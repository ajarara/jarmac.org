Aw, shut it.



## Deploying
As of now, this blog is hosted on an nginx server through apt-get. I want to move it nix management, especially as this server does not scale well at all and the more config I can sanely keep in version control the better.

Further, while I will be using pelican (moving from jekyll, both static site generators), I  will be using piwik, just so I can visualize the reality that I'm posting to /dev/null.

## Transparency
I aim to make this process as transparent as possible, excepting secrets and server details. So I'm removing the Makefile and fabfile.py, which are both autogenerated and look like I won't be changing often. If I make any notable changes, I will likely include them here. I will definitely be modifying pelican's configuration, 

## Code Snippets
Relevant parts of nginx.conf
``` bash
$ diff default.conf default.old

<       root /home/ajarara/_site;
---
>       root /usr/share/nginx/www;
```
