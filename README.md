> "But you're not an organization!!"


Aw, shut it.


This readme will serve as a catalog of all the information needed to start a server. I'll leave out specifics, like what theme I'm running (although that [https://euer.krebsco.de/piwik-for-this-blog.html](does make a difference in functionality), unfortunately)

## Deploying
As of now, this blog is hosted on an nginx server through apt-get. I want to move it to nix management, especially as this server does not scale well at all and the more config I can sanely keep in version control the better.

When I see 'doesn't scale well at all' I mean I run oom just running nix-env -q. Attempts to compile it with the Boehm GC (as described in the wiki) doesn't work, as I can't even compile ZNC. What does work, very, very well is the ability to install locally on the machine, export it to a closure, and then rsync it over to the machine and import it to the store. Since these files are gigantic and vary immensely, I'm not going to place them in version control, but I will try to at least describe the steps needed to do so in a post later on.

Further, while I will be using pelican (moving from jekyll, both static site generators), I  will be using piwik, just so I can visualize the reality that I'm posting to /dev/null.

I use rsync over SSH to deploy. I aim to keep as much deploy logic locally as possible, including login credentials (another reason to use RSA keys!) The only thing I did on the remote server is create a symlink from /usr/share/nginx/www to where it is pushed to.

I've considered git as a deployment model instead but I know octopress has growing pains from adopting that. I don't like pain.

## Transparency
I aim to make this process as transparent as possible, excepting secrets and server details. So I'm removing the Makefile and fabfile.py, which are both autogenerated and look like I won't be changing often. If I make any notable changes, I will likely include them here. I will definitely be modifying pelican's configuration,
